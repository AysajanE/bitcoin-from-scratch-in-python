This \"bit mixer\" contains a number of bit shifts and binary operations orchestrated in a way that is hardly intuitive, but that results in a fixed-size, random-looking short digest of any variably-sized original message subject to the scrambling is not invertible and also it is computationaly impossible to construct a different message that hashes to any given digest. But note that it does not mean there are no two original messages that hash to the same digest. As a matter of fact, theoretically there exist two different messages with the same hash value because of a simple fact: The input size of SHA256 > the output size. But it is just computational impossible to actually find that other message that gives us the same hash value.\n",

But since we just created both of these addresses, there will not be any BTC in them. So we need to first get some \"free\" BTC by asking some available faucets. Of course those BTC have no value since we are playing with test network, not the Main Network. Test network is the \"parallel universe\" developer-intended Bitcoin network. I just googled \"bitcoin testnet faucet\" and the first result came out was https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/. I used this website to\n",
    "get my BTC for the first address. [The result](https://www.blockchain.com/btc-testnet/address/n1zrQKCc6K3sKiFv5hLg8JoPNLPbTZpC9k) shows that I now have $0.01490097 BTC in my first wallet.\n",

    "this is just SHA256 double hash (hash of a hash) of the transaction data structure. In Bitcoin double SHA256 hashes are used quite often\n",
    "instead of a single hash for added security. But I am not quite sure what security needs to be added for a transaction id. \n",
    "- Inputs and Outputs. As we can see, the faucet transaction has one input and two outputs. The input came from address _tb1qyshspra4yeetah4c3m2c2lje3ffzfe3yq4k92m_ of value 28.22958907 BTC. There were two outputs and first one is associated with our address. \n",
    "Our address received 0.01490097 BTC. The address in the second output is unknown and it received 28.21453860 BTC. We can do a quick math here:\n",

    "$$28.22958907 - (0.01490097+28.21453860)=0.00014950$$\n",

    "2. Fee Rewrad. And then there is second reward of 0.00447932 BTC, which is the sum of all transaction fees paid by the users whose transactions\n",
    "were included in this block by the miner.\n",

    "- Size. Also note that this transaction was 228 bytes.\n",
